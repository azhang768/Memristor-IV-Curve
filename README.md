# Memristor-IV-Curve
# plot_memristor2.py generates a CCW orientation hysteresis curve (shown by Figure 2) to demonstrate the different curves, while plot_memristor.py generates a CW orientation hysteresis zoomed in to focus only on the linear region (shown by Figure 1) to demonstrate the different resistances.
